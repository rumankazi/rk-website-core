# Semantic Release Integration

This project now uses [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) for automated versioning and releases. This replaces the complex Dependabot automation with a much cleaner, standardized approach.

## What Changed

### üîÑ Before (Complex Dependabot)

- Overcomplicated dependency name filtering
- Manual label management
- Custom version bump logic
- Separate workflows for different update types

### ‚ú® After (Semantic Release)

- **Conventional Commits**: Standard commit message format
- **Automated Versioning**: Semantic versioning based on commit types
- **Automated Changelogs**: Generated from conventional commits
- **Simplified Dependabot**: Focuses on PR management and commit formatting
- **Unified Release Process**: Same process for features, fixes, and dependencies

## How It Works

### 1. Conventional Commits

All commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```bash
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Examples:**

```bash
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve database connection timeout
docs: update API documentation
build: upgrade Next.js to v15
fix(security): patch vulnerability in auth library
feat!: remove deprecated API endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: The old authentication API has been removed
```

### 2. Version Bumping Rules

- `fix:` ‚Üí **Patch** version (0.0.1)
- `feat:` ‚Üí **Minor** version (0.1.0)
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` ‚Üí **Major** version (1.0.0)
- `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `build:`, `ci:` ‚Üí **Patch** version
- `chore:` ‚Üí **No release**

### 3. Automated Dependabot Integration

Dependabot PRs are now automatically formatted with proper conventional commit messages:

- **Patch updates**: `fix: upgrade package-name to v1.2.3`
- **Minor updates**: `feat: upgrade package-name to v1.2.0`
- **Major updates**: Manual review required, uses `feat!:` format
- **Security updates**: `fix(security): upgrade package-name to v1.2.3`

### 4. Release Workflow

#### Automatic Releases (CI/CD)

1. **Quality Gate**: All tests and checks must pass
2. **Commit Analysis**: Determines if release is needed
3. **Version Calculation**: Based on conventional commits since last release
4. **Changelog Generation**: Automatic from commit messages
5. **GitHub Release**: Created with release notes
6. **Package Version**: Updated in package.json

#### Manual Testing (Local)

```bash
# Test what would be released (dry-run)
pnpm semantic-release:local

# Test with full GitHub integration (requires GITHUB_TOKEN)
pnpm semantic-release:dry-run
```

## Developer Workflow

### 1. Making Changes

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .

# Commit with conventional format (commitlint enforces this)
git commit -m "feat: add user profile page"

# Push to feature branch
git push origin feature/user-profile
```

### 2. Pull Requests

- **Title**: Use conventional commit format
- **Description**: Explain the changes
- **Review**: Normal code review process
- **Merge**: Squash merge to main (preserves conventional commit format)

### 3. Releases

- **Automatic**: Triggered on merge to `main` branch
- **Quality Gate**: Must pass all CI checks
- **Version**: Automatically determined by semantic-release
- **Changelog**: Generated from commit messages
- **GitHub Release**: Created automatically

## Branch Strategy

- **`main`**: Production releases (latest versions)
- **`develop`**: Pre-releases (beta versions)
- **Feature branches**: Normal development workflow

## Configuration Files

- **`.releaserc.json`**: Main semantic-release configuration
- **`.commitlintrc.json`**: Commit message validation rules
- **`.husky/commit-msg`**: Pre-commit hook for message validation
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`**: Automated release workflow
- **`.github/workflows/dependabot.yml`**: Simplified Dependabot automation

## Benefits

1. **üéØ Predictable Releases**: Version numbers have meaning
2. **üìù Automatic Changelogs**: Generated from commit messages
3. **üîÑ Simplified Dependabot**: Focuses on safety and conventional commits
4. **‚úÖ Quality Gates**: No releases without passing tests
5. **üè∑Ô∏è Consistent Labeling**: Based on semantic meaning
6. **üì¶ GitHub Integration**: Automatic releases with proper release notes
7. **üöÄ Developer Experience**: Clear commit message format with validation

## Migration Notes

- **Old Dependabot PRs**: Will still work but won't have automatic conventional commit formatting
- **Existing Releases**: Semantic-release will continue from current version
- **Commit History**: No need to rewrite existing commits
- **Team Training**: Everyone needs to learn conventional commit format (enforced by commitlint)
